Luckily for us, the local GameStop near us had a sale on games at the time. We had not too much trouble figuring out what 3 prices would be in budget for us. The first two were easy choices, but the last one we had to stop and think for a second.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"512\" src=\"http:\/\/localhost\/testsite\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/PS4-Console-wDS4-1024x512.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-65\" srcset=\"http:\/\/localhost\/testsite\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/PS4-Console-wDS4-1024x512.png 1024w, http:\/\/localhost\/testsite\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/PS4-Console-wDS4-300x150.png 300w, http:\/\/localhost\/testsite\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/PS4-Console-wDS4-768x384.png 768w, http:\/\/localhost\/testsite\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/PS4-Console-wDS4.png 1280w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><figcaption>The PS4&#8217;s controller comes with a new touchpad in the center of the controller that adds even more control options to games.<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>We were looking at all of AAA games of years past and had to choose a winner. My sister decided we should get an Assassin\u2019s Creed game, but that didn\u2019t narrow it down to one just yet.

Graham Bell, inventor of the telephone.<\/figcaption><\/figure><\/li><\/ul><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I\u2019ve previously played games in the Assassin\u2019s Creed series in the past, but only on the PC since we didn\u2019t have a compatible console yet at the time in which I played them. Despite being historical fiction, much of it is very real, such as the cities. The developers go the extra mile to make it accurate by using many references to create the in-game world in each game. Even the reconstruction of the Notre Dame Cathedral used the scans from Assassin\u2019s Creed as a reference as the original building plans had been lost. That being said, it was especially impressive on a big screen. The twins, though being related, have a different approach as to how they seek to liberate the city. The brother, Jacob, takes a more direct approach, forming his own gang to beat Starrick\u2019s in control of poorer boroughs and taking the fight right to Starrick\u2019s associates and assets taking the \u201csoothing syrup\u201d off of the streets, preventing a bank heist, and preventing the Corrupt Practices Act. The sister, Evie, takes a more indirect approach by focusing on finding powerful relics such as The Shroud which is said to be able to heal any wounds and even bring someone back to life, her journey takes her to investigating landmarks around the city. The game allows you to climb and run almost anywhere so you really get to see both the beauty and grittiness of the city from any angle. The combat is based on counters allowing the protagonists to chain together offense against multiple enemies. The twins eventually free the city of London from Starrick\u2019s stranglehold in a seemingly impossible battle when he gets his hands upon the Shroud in the palace\u2019s vault and become inducted in Queen Victoria\u2019s Knights of the Garter after saving the palace from a bomb during the grand ball.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>When my sister and I went out shopping for games for the new console, we only had a budget of&hellip;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"parent":0,"menu_order":0,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","template":"","meta":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/testsite\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/142"}],"collection":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/testsite\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages"}],"about":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/testsite\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/page"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/testsite\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/testsite\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=142"}],"version-history":[{"count":2,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/testsite\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/142\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":144,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/testsite\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/142\/revisions\/144"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/testsite\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=142"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
